Original idea:
https://github.com/joncage/ed-scout

Added Elite Dangerous planet info on screen (cockpit) while exploring. (no need for 2nd screen or alt-tab out of ED)

Only works when ED is in Window(-borderless) mode, not Fullscreen.

Uses:
Planet calculation from https://github.com/joncage/ed-scout
Listview from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13006/Extended-ListView
Planet and Star definition from https://github.com/EDSM-NET/FrontEnd
Gets star system info from https://www.edsm.net/
